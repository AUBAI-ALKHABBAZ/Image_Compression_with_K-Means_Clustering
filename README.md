scikit-learn: Image Compression with K-Means Clustering
About this Project
In this project, you will apply the k-means clustering unsupervised learning algorithm using scikit-learn and Python to build an image compression application with interactive controls. By the end of this 45-minute long project, you will be competent in pre-processing high-resolution image data for k-means clustering, conducting basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization, applying a computationally time-efficient implementation of the k-means algorithm, Mini-Batch K-Means, to compress images, and leverage the Jupyter widgets library to build interactive GUI components to select images from a drop-down list and pick values of k using a slider.

This course runs on Coursera's hands-on project platform called Rhyme. On Rhyme, you do projects in a hands-on manner in your browser. You will get instant access to pre-configured cloud desktops containing all of the software and data you need for the project. Everything is already set up directly in your internet browser so you can just focus on learning. For this project, youâ€™ll get instant access to a cloud desktop with Python, Jupyter, and scikit-learn pre-installed.
Glossary
Here's a brief description of terms used in the Image Compression with K-Means Clustering hands on project:

        1- scikit-learn - A powerful Python library for machine learning and predictive modeling built on Numpy, SciPy and matplotlib.

        2- matplotlib - A plotting library for the Python programming language.

        3- NumPy - The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. 

        4- Unsupervised learning - Learning where the expected prediction (label or ground truth) is not available for each sample when fitting the model.

        5- K-Means clustering - An unsupervised learning algorithm used to find clusters in data.

        6- Array - A data structure that contains a collection of elements. Data can be stored in NumPy arrays, allowing for computations to performed on them.

        7- Jupyter widgets - Widgets are eventful python objects that have a representation in the browser, often as a control like a slider, textbox, etc. You can use widgets to build interactive GUIs for your notebooks.

        8- GUI - Graphical user interface.

9- Centroid - The average or arithmetic mean of all the points of an object.
